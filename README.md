# TSA Video Game Design 2026

TSA Video Game Design submission for the 2025-26 season

## Accessibility Note
Because this game requires a lot of movement while menus are open,
we had to sacrifice some of the keyboard and controller defaults for
navigating UI. The main changes are as follows:

* Space bar no longer clicks/selects UI &mdash; <kbd>Enter</kbd> may be used instead
* Arrow keys no longer available for navigation &mdash; use <kbd>Tab</kbd>/<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> instead

For controllers:

* Left stick and D-pad cannot be used for UI navigation &mdash; Right stick may be used instead
* Right button (B for XBox controllers) is select
* Bumpers/top buttons can be used for next/previous, like <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>
